    ``Path.mkdir(parents=True)`` followed by a path-based ``os.chmod`` leaves a
    TOCTOU window: between a directory being created and the mode change, any
    path component -- not only the final one -- can be replaced with a
    symlink, redirecting the hardening to an unrelated target (#741). This
    walks up from ``path`` to find the nearest already-existing ancestor, then
    walks back down creating each missing component with ``os.mkdir(...,
    dir_fd=...)`` and hardening it with an ``O_NOFOLLOW``-opened descriptor
    (``os.fchmod``) before descending further -- so no step ever re-resolves a
    mutable pathname, and an ancestor that already existed before this call
    (which may be shared with other processes) is never touched.

    ``exist_ok`` mirrors ``Path.mkdir``'s parameter of the same name: when
    ``False``, the final component turning out to already exist by the time
    this walk reaches it (created by a racing process between the caller's
    existence check and this call) raises ``FileExistsError`` instead of
    being silently accepted -- otherwise ``secure_directory(..., exist_ok=False)``
    (account creation's rewrite-protection, ``create_account``) would lose its
    create-only guarantee purely because the target was fully missing when
    checked (cycle-review round 2 finding).

    Every *non-final* component racing into existence between the ancestor
    walk above and this loop's own ``os.mkdir`` call is rejected unconditionally
    (``exist_ok`` does not extend to it): silently descending into a directory
    this call did not create -- even one merely raced into place by another
    local process, not necessarily a symlink -- would mean hardening and
    building the rest of the tree inside a directory this function does not
    control, defeating "only components we created are ours to harden."
